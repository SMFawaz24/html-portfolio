<h1>The Best Movies According to Fawaz</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
 <hr/>
 <h3>Interstellar</h3>
 <p>The cinematography and visual effects are incredible. Along with the story and soundtrack.</p>
 <h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
 <p>One of the best superhero movies if not THE BEST. Portrayals of Joker and Batman by Heath Ledger and Christian Bale repectively are outstanding.</p>
 <h3>Spiderman 2</h3>
 <p>Almost everything is perfect and relevant even in today's time. The hero, story, soundtrack, villian and conclusion.</p>
